# The-Social-Network ![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-red)


  ## Description
  For this application I built a fast acting API for a social network web app where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. Similar to twitter this application uses Mongoose and express to create the routes needed in the backend. Also including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the users thoughts and reactions.
